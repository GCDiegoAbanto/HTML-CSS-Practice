                <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, grated</li>
                <li>1 tsp hot smoked paprika</li>
                <li>80g sundried tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>600g skinless and boneless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>100ml chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>jacket potatoes, chopped parsley and soured cream, to serve (optional)</li>

            </ul>      

            <!-- Really tempted to include <br> tags, will hold on till the next one though -->
            <p><b>STEP 1</b></p>
            <p>Fry the chorizo over a medium heat in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole dish for 5 mins or until it releases its oil
                 and starts to char at the edges. Add the onion and fry for 5 mins more or until soft. Tip in the garlic and cook for 2 mins 
                 before stirring in the paprika and sundried tomatoes. Add the chicken thighs and fry for 2 mins each side until they are 
                 well coated in the spices and beginning to brown.</p>
        
            <p><b>STEP 2</b></p>
            <p>Pour in the chopped tomatoes and stock, and turn the heat down. Cover and cook for 40 mins until the chicken is 
                falling apart and the sauce is thick. Stir the lemon juice through. Serve by piling spoonfuls of the ragu into 
                hot jacket potatoes with parsley sprinkled over and a dollop of soured cream, if you like.</p>

            <h3><li>Pasta alla Trapanese (Sicilian Tomato Pesto)</li></h3>

                <p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>

                <ul>

                    <li>1/2 cup whole roasted almonds</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to tast</li>
                    <li>1 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese, plus more to taste</li>
                    <li>1 cup packed fresh basil leaves</li>
                    <li>4 mint leaves (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 pound red cherry tomatoes or red grape tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 pound busiate pasta, or other curly shaped pasta, such as fusilli</li>                    

                </ul>

            <p><b>STEP 1</b></p>
            <p>Bring about 2 cups of water to a boil, remove from the heat, and stir in almonds; 
                let sit for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, and once cool enough to handle, rub skins off with your hands; 
                alternately; transfer drained almonds to a kitchen towel, then fold up the towel and rub almonds until skins 
                come off. </p>
        
            <p><b>STEP 2</b></p>
            <p>Crush sliced garlic with kosher salt in a mortar and pestle into a smooth paste. Alternately, place garlic 
                on a board and sprinkle kosher salt on top; use the flat side of the knife to flatten, mash, and scrape the 
                garlic and salt mixture until it is a smooth paste. </p>

            <p><b>STEP 3</b></p>
            <p>Add peeled almonds to the jar of a blender, followed by the cheese, basil, mint, garlic paste, oil, and 
                tomatoes. Add the ingredients in this order, so that the almonds and cheese have a chance to grind 
                before the wetter ingredients mix in.</p>

            <p><b>STEP 4</b></p>
            <p>Begin to pulse blender on and off until almonds and cheese are ground, then continue to pulse until remaining 
                ingredients are incorporated. Blend on high until the pesto is as coarse or smooth as you like. </p>

            <h3><li>Air Fryer Samosas</li></h3>

            <p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>

            <ul>

                <li>12 ounces yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
                <li>2/3 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
                <li>24 wonton wrappers</li>
                <li>cooking spray</li>

            </ul>


            <p><b>STEP 1</b></p>
            <p>Add potatoes to a small saucepan and cover with salted water; bring to a boil over high heat. 
                Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; 
                mash until mostly smooth with a few small chunks remaining. </p>

            <p><b>STEP 2</b></p>
            <p>In the same saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender,
                 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in ginger and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add garam masala, cumin,
                  salt, and (if using) cayenne; cook about 30 seconds more. Stir in mashed potatoes and peas; cook until 
                  warmed through. Remove from heat; stir in cilantro.</p>
    
            <p><b>STEP 3</b></p>
            <p>Arrange wonton wrappers on a clean work surface; evenly spoon filling into centers of wontonwrappers. 
                Lightly wet borders of wrappers with water. Fold two corners together to form triangles. Press edges to seal. 
                Coat both sides of samosas with cooking spray.</p>
    
            <!-- This had more steps but cutting it for simplicity -->

            <p><b>STEP 4</b></p>
            <p>Working in batches if needed, arrange samosas in an even layer in the basket. Cook, turning once halfway through, 
                until samosas are golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes.</p>
