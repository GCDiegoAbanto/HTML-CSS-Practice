    <h3 id="html">Why is html important</h3>


    <!-- Considered including <br> tags here but I want to keep consistent in doing 2 types of tags per website -->
    <p>HTML is one of the cornerstones of web development, as developers use it to structure a website’s content. Essentially, 
        it’s the code that dictates where all the website elements are and how they appear to the user.</p>
    
    <p>As you’ll see, there are many benefits to learning HTML, and they extend far beyond becoming a web developer. Still, 
        web developers are in high demand, and HTML is a great skill to have in your tool belt if you decide to look for a new job in the future.</p>
    </p>

    <h4>7 Benefits of learning HTML</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>HTML can help you build your own unique website</li>
        <li>You’ll no longer have to wait for your IT team</li>
        <li>HTML helps you understand how to make things more accessible</li>
        <li>Knowing HTML helps you collaborate more effectively with technical teams</li>
        <li>Your designs can shine with HTML</li>
        <li>HTML skills will open up more income-generating opportunities</li>
        <li>HTML can help you to learn other coding languages easier</li>

    <h3 id="tatoes">Why are potatoes so great?</h3>

    <p>I am biased since there are so many potato species in Peru, but there are many health benefits associated to them</p>

    <p>In addition to starch, potatoes contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They’re rich in vitamin C, which is an antioxidant. 
        Potatoes were a life-saving food source in early times because the vitamin C prevented scurvy. Another major nutrient in 
        potatoes is potassium, an electrolyte which aids in the workings of our heart, muscles, and nervous system. Potato skin 
        contains fiber, which is important for digestive health.</p>

    <p>Different types of potatoes, especially those that come in other colors, contain more nutrients that have health benefits. 
        In general, the darker the potato, the more antioxidants it contains. Sweet potatoes are a good source of vitamin A, an 
        important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants including anthocyanins which may 
        prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health. </p>

    <em>Types of potatoes (common ones at least)</em>
    <ul>
        
        
        <li>Fingerling potatoes: Small, stubby, finger-shaped potatoes</li>
        <li>Russet potatoes: Large potatoes with dark brown skin and white flesh</li>
        <li>Sweet potatoes: Large potatoes with bright orange flesh and sweet taste</li>
        <li>White and red potatoes: Many sizes and shapes with either white- or red-colored skin</li>
        <li>Purple potatoes: Oval-shaped potatoes with a purplish-black skin and purple flesh</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 id="crabs">Top 10 crabs</h3>

    <p>This is my list for top 10 crabs that exist</p>

    <ol>
        <li>All crabs.</li>
        <p>Every crab is perfect, there is no need to compare them. All of them are tied for 1st place in my heart.</p>
        <li>Mole crabs.</li>
        <p>I hate these. I've stepped on too many by accident before.</p>
